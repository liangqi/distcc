To build: the simple way is to just do

  run_all_autoconf.sh    # invokes autoconf and autoheader using
                         # version info in the file version.sh
  configure              # creates distcc/config.h and makefiles
  make                   # build

but the recommended way is to build in a different directory tree
than the source tree:

  run_all_autoconf.sh
  mkdir obj
  cd obj
  ../configure
  make

Either of these methods will:

 - compile distcc
 - compile Python C extensions

To test:

   make check

To test installation using your own machine as a distcc compilation server:

 - start daemon (in one window):

    distcc/distccd --wizard --allow 127.0.0.1

 - compile (in another):

    DISTCC_POTENTIAL_HOSTS=127.0.0.1 pump BUILDCOMMAND

See the shell script pump in this directory.
