## These changes were made internally to Google, and not integrated
## into the main distcc distribution until 2008.  The dates here are
## the dates they were applied to the internal-Google branch, and
## interleave with the changes to the main branch, below.

* Thu Jun 14 2007 Manos Renieris <opensource@google.com>
- Added all the distcc-pump related parts to distcc.spec.
- Changed the way the package is built.
- Remove source package generation.
- Man pages are now unzipped.
				   
* Mon May 29 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Add -r<PORT> option to lsdistcc to specify which port to connect to.
  ("-p", "-o", and "-t" were already taken.)
- Fix a bug where "lsdistcc distcc%d" was only returning the first host.
- Add some unit tests for lsdistcc.
- Also tidy up the usage message a little.

* Mon Feb 8 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Added hosts list option to lsdistcc, such that lsdistcc can check only the
  hosts listed on the given list. The host list is given in command line.

* Wed Jan 31 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Added _libdir definition in rpms.epc.
- Changed Name, Version, and Release to the ones passed by --define.
- Updated the server init script to give different path of ACL files for grhat
  and goobuntu as suggested by Arthur Hyun <opensource@google.com>.

* Mon Jan 22 2007 Dongmin Zhang <opensource@google.com>
- Fixed a bug in timeout patch. Added sigaction to catch SIGCHLD such that the
  select() in dcc_collect_child() could break out when the file is finished to
  compile.

* Fri Dec 1 2006 Ollie Wild <opensource@google.com>
- Removed the 01-distcc-gdb-20051210.patch patch.  The parser in this was too
  naive to deal with output generate with the -directives-only flag.  Also, it
  should no longer be needed with recent versions of gcc.
- Removed the 10-distcc-before-cpp_locking-sub-gdb.patch and
  12-distcc-after-cpp_locking-add-gdb.patch patches.  These were just modifying
  the former patch.

* Fri Sep 8 2006 Michael Moss <opensource@google.com>
- Update install and init scripts to work on Debian and Red Hat (allowing the
  .rpm to be converted to .deb with alien, and then installed on Debian).
  Some noteworthy changes:
  - Deb - Remove unused defaults file /etc/default/distcc.
  - Deb - No longer uses debconf.
  - RH  - useradd is run in post- rather than pre- install.
  - RH  - distcc server is automatically started.
- Added enable/disable commands to init scripts so the daemon can be
  "permanently" disabled on misbehaving hosts.
- Added patches to allow building LSB-compliant binaries.
- Reorganized some existing patches to better partition functionality.

* Tue Feb 28 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- removed cache again

* Mon Feb 20 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- added cache

* Mon Feb 6 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- use Josh's randomize patch instead of Michael's,
  since Josh's seems to perform better in our tests
- added disk space statistic on http interface
- lsdistcc now has -x option to output info even on down hosts (will be useful for server side caching)

* Tue Jan 2 2006 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- removed load shedding patch (we have swap turned on, so overload isn't as bad)
- added stats for timeout

* Wed Dec 8 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- lsdistcc now has -l option, better -v output
- distccd now has nicer logging, --limit-load option, bugfixes in load shedding

* Tue Nov 22 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- rejects jobs if load too high
- serves up stats via http on port 3633
- lsdistcc now has new -p and -c0 options

* Wed Nov  2 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- updated lsdistcc to use the longer of the two of HOST and HOSTNAME
  to handle shells that set HOST to the nonqualified hostname,
  but HOSTNAME to the FQDN

* Thu Oct 13 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- updated lsdistcc patch
- removed gcc as a dependency, since we want to use it with
  a wide range of other compilers (and in our case, not the
  standard gcc), and it's impractical to list them all as dependencies

* Fri Sep 16 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- now reads /etc/distcc/hosts instead of /usr/etc/distcc/hosts
- replaced distcc-2.18.3-rhl.patch with distcc-2.18.3-stringmap.patch
  The stringmap patch updates the rhl init.d script to know about
  all installed crosstool toolchains, and enables fuzzy path matching
  This is useful if the toolchains are not installed at the same
  prefix on all systems
- removed distcc-domain.patch
- added distcc-2.18.3-lsdistcc.patch

* Sat Sep  3 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- now reads /etc/distcc/hosts instead of /usr/etc/distcc/hosts
- applied distcc-domain-2.patch

* Thu Jun 15 2005 Dan Kegel <dank@kegel.com>
- Updated to 2.18.3
- applied --randomize patch and cpp_locking patch
- redhat init.d script reads /etc/distccd.allow to construct --allow arguments
- added scriptlets from dag's package, but don't start service on install,
  and call it distcc rather than distccd (to match the current 
  packaging's old practice)

    Summary:
      Return errors, rather than aborting.
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-143

    Don't call rs_fatal; instead return an error.  It was giving warnings on
    non-gcc compilers because it wasn't seen as noreturn, and anyhow aborting
    is a bit untidy.

    Summary:
      Always build conftest.c locally
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-137

    Problem: configure tests are typically very quick to build; also
    configure can be very sensitive to stderr warnings or other small
    variations between machines.
    
    Fix: To make things faster and safer, build conftest.* locally; also
    tmp.conftest.* used by ccache.
    
    * src/filename.c (dcc_source_needs_local): New function.
    
    * src/arg.c (dcc_scan_args): Check.
    
    * cases/conftest.c: Manual test case.

    Summary:
      Reset PATH when running maintainer-check
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-136

    Problem: Installed copies of distcc and/or ccache were getting invoked
    from inside the test suite in a confusing way.
    
    Fix: Force the path to just /bin:/usr/bin:`pwd`

    Summary:
      Remove mmap when receiving uncompressed data
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-135

    Problem: Calling msync seems likely to force disk IO, but not calling it
    is unsafe.
    
    Fix: In fact, we can probably do fine by just using plain IO to receive
    data.  This is already done for compressed data.
    
    * src/pump.c (dcc_r_bulk_plain): Remove.
    
    * src/pump.c (dcc_r_bulk): Just pump bytes through when receiving data;
      don't worry about mmap.  Doc.
    
    * src/bulk.c (dcc_r_file): Output files can be WRONLY if we're not using
      mmap.
    
    * src/io.c (dcc_want_mmap): Remove.
    
    * man/distcc.1, man/distccd.1: No more mmap!

    Summary:
      remove signal-based timeouts
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-127

    Problem: Using alarms to enforce timeouts is inherently unsafe, because
    it might leave e.g. the resolver or C library in an inconsistent state.
    
    Fix: Don't use signals.  We can do something simpler and safer using
    select() in a future commit.
    
    We no longer have a timeout on name resolution; the best fix for this is
    to set an appropriate timeout in resolv.conf.

    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-124

    Short 5s CONNECT timeout covers only name resolution and TCP
    connection.
    
    SEND phase and timeout should include sending the header, and waiting
    for cpp to complete.  60s to send.
    
    Allow up to 20mins for compilation.

    Summary:
      fix timeout crash bug
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-123

    Problem: Was using longjmp() from the SIGALRM handler to return an
    error.  This is not safe.
    
    Fix: Use siglongjmp() instead.  That may not be completely safe
    either, but it might fix the problem.

    Summary:
      dcc_r_bulk_lzo1x: fix nasty bug in mmap recv lzo
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-44

    When reading in compressed data, our initial buffer might not be large
    enough for the actual compressed data, so we need to free it and make
    a larger one.  When freeing the mmapped buffer, we need to pass both
    address and length of the mapping.  
    
    The bug was that we increased the length before unmapping and
    therefore randomly unmapped some block of memory, causing a crash
    later on.
    
    Fix: don't increase the length until we're done with the old value.
    
    This code is really too complex to be safe.

    Summary:
      patch from joshh to randomize host list
    Revision:
      distcc--devel--2--patch-21

    In http://lists.samba.org/archive/distcc/2004q2/002250.html, Dan
    proposed randomizing the hosts list.  Here's a patch to add that
    feature, controlled by a special --randomize option in the hosts list.
    On a large shared build cluster, this helps spread the load
    without requiring separate hosts lists for each user.
    Martin, what do you think?

	* src/arg.c (dcc_scan_args): Allow "-Wa,-xarch=v8" to be remote.
	Reported by Ben Scarlet.

	* test/testdistcc.py (ScanArgs_Case): Add test cases for -x
	handling.

	* src/arg.c (dcc_scan_args): Handle invocations like "-xcpp" with
	no space after -x.  Suggested by Ben Scarlet.

	* test/testdistcc.py (CompressedCompile_Case): Add a test of
	compression.

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Include sys/loadavg.h if available.

	* configure.ac: Check for sys/loadavg.h.  Suggested by Dimitri
	Papadopoulos.

	* man/distcc.1: Document comments in host files.

	* test/testdistcc.py (ParseHostSpec_Case): Add test for
	"localhostbutnotreally".

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_parse_hosts): Fix matching of hosts with names
	like "localhost2".

2004-02-20  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/compress.c (dcc_r_bulk_lzo1x): ftruncate the file after
	munmapping, rather than before.  Might be better on HP-UX which
	has problems with IO on mapped files.

	* README.packaging: Update description of why packagers should
	change version numbers.

2004-02-19  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_sockaddr_to_string): Handle null sockaddr.

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_check_client): Handle null sockaddr.

	* src/daemon.c (dcc_inetd_server): If there is no sockaddr, pass
	it as NULL.

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_sockaddr_to_string) [ENABLE_RFC2553]:
 	Failure to convert the address to a string should be just a
 	warning, not an error.  Add special cases for unix-domain sockets
 	and unknown address families.  Possibly fixes SSH connections with
 	ENABLE_RFC2553.
 	
	* src/daemon.c (dcc_inetd_server): Downgrade warning on
	getpeername failure to just a notice message.

2004-02-19  Albert China  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Get test suite working on most of the
	platforms we support:
	
	  1. Not much use in testing with the native compiler so we
	     *force* the test suite to use gcc.

	  2. Rather than picking up gcc from $PATH, we pass the full path
	     to GCC. This avoids problems when distccd is running.

	  3. I've added known failures on some platforms. For example, the
	     assembler test should only run on Linux x86. Where we know
	     the test will fail, we print:

	DashONoSpace_Case              NOTRUN, GCC mips-tfile wants space after -o
	...
	RemoteAssemble_Case            NOTRUN, Linux x86 only
	PreprocessAsm_Case             NOTRUN, Linux x86 only
	...

	The tests pass on: HP-UX 10.20, 11.00, 11i; IRIX 6.5; Redhat Linux
	7.1, 9; Solaris 7, 8, 9; Tru64 UNIX 4.0d, 5.1

2004-02-18  Albert China  <china@thewrittenword.com>

	These patches were tested on: AIX 4.3.2, 5.1; HP-UX 10.20, 11.00,
	11i; IRIX 6.5; Redhat Linux 7.1, 9; Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, 8, 9;
	Tru64 UNIX 4.0D, 5.1:

	* src/exitcode.h: IBM C compiler doesn't like trailing commas
	after last enum constant.
	
	* src/clinet.c: Define h_errno for HP-UX 10.20.
	
	* src/distcc.h: Forward declaration of 'struct sockaddr' gives
	problems with IBM C compiler. And, it's not needed.
	
	* src/serve.c: Forgot to include <sys/socket.h> Needed on HP-UX
	10.20, 11.00, 11i.
	
	* src/types.h: Remove definition of socklen_t if unavailable. We
	not declare it correctly via autoconf.
	
	* configure.ac:
	a) Better detection for socklen_t. This code is taken from curl but
	we submitted it so we own the copyright. Feel free to use as you
	please.
	b) Existence of mmap() doesn't imply MAP_FAILED exists. So, test
	and define it if unavailable.
	c) Replace the AC_CHECK_FUNCS(connect) mess.
	
2004-01-30  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_parse_hosts): Fix problem where we accidentally
	detected localhost at end of string.

	* src/h_hosts.c (main): Fix up verbose mode.

	* test/testdistcc.py (ParseHostSpec_Case.runtest): Test parsing of
	comments in host specifications.

	* src/hosts.c (dcc_parse_hosts): Skip over hash comments in host
	specifications.

2004-01-11  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_check_client): Take list of allowed addresses
	as a new parameter so that this file doesn't depend on opt.c.

	* src/h_sa2str.c: New test harness.

	* Makefile.in (h_sa2str): new test.

2004-01-09  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* configure.ac: Make --without-gnome, --without-gtk,
	--disable-profile all turn the relevant options off rather than
	on.

	* Makefile.in: Add man/distccmon-text.1, and clean up manpage
	handling.

	* man/distccmon-text.1: Fix some typos.

	* src/dopt.c (distccd_parse_options): Option arguments should be
	held in (const char *).

	* src/setuid.c (dcc_discard_root): Must setuid after setgid, not
	before.  Fix from Wayne Davison.

	* src/mon.c (dcc_mon_check_orphans): When checking if a process
	exists, accept EPERM as indicating it exists but isn't ours.  This
	allows watching the directory of a different user.  Reported by
	Ernst Bachmann.

2003-12-21  Shri Shrikumar <shri@urbyte.com>

	* man/distccmon-text.1: New manpage.

2003-12-15  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* man/distccd.1: Mention TMPDIR.

	* man/distcc.1: We don't use a subdirectory of TMPDIR anymore.

2003-11-28  Harold L Hunt II  <huntharo@msu.edu>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Add --with-docdir=PATH option to set
	install location for documents.  The default is the same as
	previously: ${datadir}/doc/distcc.

2003-11-28  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/distcc.h (dcc_sockaddr_storage): Different method for
	choosing the type for dcc_sockaddr_storage.  We now use a plain
	sockaddr unless RFC2553 was requested, in which case we use
	sockaddr_storage.  HAVE_SOCKADDR_STORAGE is only used as a check
	that the RFC2553 implementation is reasonable.

	* src/distcc.h (dcc_sockaddr_storage): Use a new type name for our
	replacement of sockaddr_storage, rather than calling it
	sockaddr_storage, to make it more clear that it's determined by
	autoconf. 
	
	* src/prefork.c (dcc_preforked_child): Use dcc_sockaddr_storage.

	* src/dparent.c (dcc_forking_parent): Likewise.

	* src/daemon.c (dcc_inetd_server): Likewise.

2003-11-23  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* src/netutil.c (dcc_sockaddr_to_string) [ENABLE_RFC2553]: Include
	the port number in the returned string, as for !ENABLE_RFC2553.
	This looks a bit wierd for IPv6 but is legible and unambiguous at
	least for output.  Increase static buffer size.

	* src/clinet.c (dcc_connect_timed): Check SO_ERROR to see if the
	connection failed so that we can trap it at this point rather than
	waiting until we start doing IO.

	* src/distcc.h [ENABLE_RFC2553]: sockaddr_storage is required for
	RFC2553.

	* src/dparent.c (dcc_nofork_parent, dcc_forking_parent): Socket
	addresses should be stored on the stack in sockaddr_storage so
	that IPv6 addresses will fit.  We always have this type, or can
	simulate it.

	* src/prefork.c (dcc_preforked_child): Likewise.

	* src/srvnet.c (dcc_socket_listen) [ENABLE_RFC2553]: Don't prefer
	to listen on IPv4 addresses, just use whatever the operating
	system thinks is best.

	* INSTALL: Suggest using --with-gnome and --enable-rfc2553.

	* man/distccd.1: Add description of --log-level.

	* src/dopt.c: New --log-level option to accomodate people who only
	want to log errors.

	* src/trace.c, src/trace.h (rs_loglevel_from_name): New function.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Check pkg-config information for
	GNOME/GTK+ at configure time, not build time.  This is a bit
	quicker than running the script for every file we build, and means
	that PKG_CONFIG_PATH only needs to be set for configure.

	* src/lock.c: Doc.

2003-11-17  Lionel Sausin  <lionel.sausin@free.fr>

	* man/fr/distcc.1, man/fr/distccd.1: French translations of the
	manual pages.

2003-11-17  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* distcc.h: MAXPATHLEN is not defined on GNU/Hurd, so supply a
	reasonable default value of 4096.  Reported by Santiago Vila.

2003-11-17  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* sendfile.c: Documentation updates.

2003-11-17  Allan Saddi  <allan@saddi.com>

	* sendfile.c (sys_sendfile): BSD implementation of this function
	needs to return -1 when transmission fails with EAGAIN and no
	bytes were sent.

2003-11-17  Martin Pool  <mbp@sourcefrog.net>

	* setuid.c (dcc_discard_root): Wayne suggests calling
	setgid()/setuid() before doing setgroups().  setgroups() on Mac OS
	X Jaguar can't seem to handle setting to 0 groups, so just set it
	to the same as the regular group.

	  * GNOME monitor now uses a custom GtkCellRenderer subclass
	  (renderer.c, renderer.h) to draw a scarf-style history of the
	  states   for the slot.

	  * Now uses binary state files that are quicker to write out and
	  read	 in.  Not compatible with monitors from the previous
	  version.

	  * Structure renamed from dcc_mon_list to dcc_history.  Text
	  fields are   held directly in the structure to allow it to be
	  directly written   out.

	  * State files are written and rewritten in place, rather than
	  always   being renamed into place.  We cope reasonably gracefully
	  when	 reading back files that are truncated.

	  * New strlcpy() utility.

	  * Clean up cruft in dcc_lock_one() from when we had transmission
	  lock	 files.

	  * Better handling of EXEEXT to allow tab completion to work in
	  Makefiles.

	  * GNOME monitor is now constructed using libglade-2, rather than
	  the	hard way.

	  * New --enable-profile option for gprof.

	  * Depends on libglade, pango, libgnome, libgnomeui, at least if
	  you	want the graphical monitor.

	  * Change UNUSED() macro to make sure the variable is not
	  accidentally	 used.

	  * Rename state tags to consistent DCC_STATE_*

	    I think the immediately previous approach of having the monitor
	  keep
	    track of state history and draw an unlabelled striped bar is
	    probably pretty good.  However, I'd like to also rely on the
	  regular
	    table widget to give us space to draw it.

	    This code builds and gives an empty table.	The renderer is
	  here but
	    disabled.

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Accumulate all task lists in a GSList

	* src/: mon-gnome.c, state.c, state.h: Rework monitor yet again:
	  :-/

	  * State files no longer hold a history of that process's state,
	  just	 its current information, and they are removed when the
	  process   exits.

	    This means that we cannot get very fine-grained plots of
	  transitions
	    between states, but it seemed to be hard to get that
	  information
	    displayed smoothly without burning a lot of CPU.  In addition,
	  we
	    were getting hundreds of leftover state files, which slow down
	    traversing the directory and are not really necessary.

	    I'll try instead putting the burden of remembering and painting
	    history onto the monitor, since it's the only program that
	  really
	    needs that information.

	  anything yet.

2003-09-11 18:57  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: As an experiment, draw pixbufs into the task

	  to draw a chart for each host slot.  At the moment   nothing is

	  just drawing arbitrary   rectangles.

	  * Redraw window using gtk_widget_queue_draw rather than Gdk.
	  This	 seems to fix a problem with redraw.  Perhaps we were
	  passing the	wrong rectangle.

2003-09-11 15:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Set bar height from font height.

	  Now when you change the GNOME system font, all the bars redraw to

	  How cool!

2003-09-10 15:27  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* gnome/distccmon-gnome.glade: Put the chart drawing into a
	  GtkAlignment so that we can get a 6px   border around it.  It was
	  looking a bit cramped against the window border.

2003-09-10 15:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Allocate GCs for all states.

2003-09-10 14:19  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* gnome/distccmon-gnome.glade, src/mon-gnome.c: Rework again:

	  * Start adding a 'key' window showing all the state colors.

	  * Go back to a DrawingArea for showing the chart (just
	  experimental).

	  * Delete table view from monitor.

2003-09-09 18:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/state.h: States must be listed in the order in which
	  they're run.

2003-09-09 18:15  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Update every 150ms.

	  * Don't update the table.

	  * Don't include DONE tasks.

	  * Left-align filename.

	  * Don't outline tasks.

	  * Reorder color list for new state enum.

	  * Make sure all states are drawn properly.

	  This is leaking memory badly!

2003-09-09 17:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/compile.c: Record input filename as soon as it is known.

2003-09-09 17:53  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/mon-gnome.c: Draw compilation tasks as striated rectangles.

2003-09-08 16:19  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/state.c: Make sure to actually record our state!

2003-09-08 16:12  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: state.c, state.h, mon-text.c: Put state names into a new

	  We just need to make sure   that their state gets set to
	  DCC_STATE_DONE.

2003-09-08 15:59  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  src/mon.c, src/mon.h, src/remote.c, src/state.c, src/state.h,
	  src/where.c: Many changes to the representation of the client
	  state to make it easier to draw a history.

	  * State is now stored as a natively encoded struct in a disk
	  file,   rather than using our network protocol.  This is slightly
	  faster,   makes it easier to store multiple fields, and avoids
	  tangling up the   state file handling (which ought to ignore
	  errors) with network IO.

	  * States can now be written and read with one atomic IO, and we
	  don't   use temporary files.

	  * States are represented by integers not strings.

	  * There is space in the state file for a history of times that it
	    entered particular states.

	* src/: daemon.h, dparent.c, dsignal.c, prefork.c, serve.c, util.c:
	  Rework some daemon signal handling designs to better suit a
	  preforking server.

	   * Daemon now runs in a single process group in all modes.

	   * Use signal() rather than sigaction() for simplicity.

	   * Killing the daemon kills all running children.  This is more
	     consistent with other daemons like Apache.  Any clients ought
	  to
	     fall back to local compilation, as they will have to do
	  anyhow.
	     Daemon is killed by reraising the signal, rather than exiting.

	   * Print a message when terminated by a signal that fits better
	  with
	     the strsignal() output.

	   * When terminated, explicitly run cleanups rather than relying
	  on
	     exit().

	   * Accepted children are not run in a separate group, because
	  this
	     will not work for preforked jobs.

	* src/where.c: dcc_pick_host_from_list: Return EXIT_NO_HOSTS on

	  * Update to build cleanly in this tree.

	  * dcc_run_piped_cmd: Make sure pipes are always closed because
	  the	program will not necessarily abort if we fail to connect
	  and we   don't want to leak file descriptors.

	  * dcc_ssh_connect: Build connection command in argv[] not a

	* src/dparent.c: Fix small signal handling race that would
	  occasionally cause distccd   not to exit when signalled.  Pointed
	  out by Vance Lankhaar, solution   advice from Andrew Tridgell.

	    The problem was that a signal could arrive after we checked the
	    global indicator, but before entering accept().  So the daemon
	  would
	    need to wait for the accept to complete before it could respond
	  to
	    the signal.

	    Since the daemon only needs to do very simple cleanup, we now
	  simply
	    do it in line in the signal handler and never return.

2003-03-12 18:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  This is the start of a script that runs distcc to build various
	  open source programs, as an overall test of correctness, and to

2002-11-08 18:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exec.c: Do not take a lock on localhost when spawning
	  commands.

	  This is intended to get rid of a race condition that will
	  sometimes deadlock the client:

	    Two clients, P1 and P2, are both trying to compile on remote
	  machine
	    R.	Therefore, they both need to get a lock on localhost to run
	  cpp,
	    and on R.  If they acquire the locks in the opposite order,
	  then
	    they will block holding locks, and deadlock.  The ordering is
	    indeterminate because the cpp lock is acquired from the
	  separate
	    process forked to run cpp.

	  This was not evident in 0.12 and earlier because there was no
	  limit on the number of locks that could be taken.

	  On the server side, there are better places to regulate process
	  load than here.  We should instead hold off on accepting
	  connections until we have space to handle them.

	  On the client, we should take locks only when compiling locally.
	  cpp is cheap enough that it doesn't really need to be taken into
	  account.

	* src/distcc.c, src/dparent.c, src/exec.c, src/serve.c,
	  src/where.c, NEWS:	 * Remove support for feeding the compiler
	  from a fifo.	The gain from
		using fifos does not seem to justify the maintenance
	  burden.  (Martin Pool)

		 - This makes the behaviour more consistent, because some
	  platforms
		   (Cygwin) or filesystems (NFS, strangely) can't use
	  fifos.  It removes
		   a code path and a slightly complex autodetection.

		 - Using fifos makes some potential scheduling improvements
	  hard: the
		   server can't make good decisions about how many tasks to
	  run, because
		   each one will only use a fraction of the CPU.  The
	  client cannot
		   serialize file transmission, which would probably be
	  desirable.

		 - Using fifos makes reliably handling compiler failures
	  slightly
		   harder: the compiler may crash or exit at any time,
	  which will in
		   turn cause the server to hang if it later tries to open
	  or write to
		   the fifo.  In previous versions, distcc tried to handle
	  this by
		   catching SIGCHLD when the child terminated, and aborting
	  the
		   operation, but I am not sure that the method is
	  completely reliable.

	      * Use return codes more consistently

	      * Change log levels slightly to try to make sure nothing is
		emitted for successful compilation or even only compiler
		errors.

	      * Detached daemon now ignores hangup signal.

	      * Follow Unix convention of returning 128+SIGNAL if the
	  compiler exits
		with a signal.	(Martin Pool)

	      * Write server error messages to a log file and send them
	  back to
		the client on completion.

2002-09-01 08:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: distcc.c, serve.c: dcc_accept_job:

	   * Use new dcc_mkfifo routine to make sure the fifo is created
	     properly.

	   * Use new dcc_r_file_body, dcc_r_file and dcc_r_fifo routines to
	  make

2002-09-01 08:36  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/tempfile.c: dcc_mkfifo:

	   * New routine.

	   * We now unlink before trying to create a fifo, to make sure
	  that if
	     somehow that name is already in use by a file or fifo we won't
	  get
	     confused.

2002-09-01 08:29  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2002-09-01 07:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/bulk.c: Doc.

	  dcc_r_file:

	   * Unlink the name before starting to receive the file.  This may
	     prevent bugs where the name already existed as a fifo.  The
	  old
	     code would have opened the fifo rather than replacing it, and
	     therefore would hang.  Afterwards, create with O_EXCL.

	   * Check that the file is successfully closed.  (Might catch
	  ENOSPC or similar.)

	  dcc_r_fd: Fix return code to be the result of transferring the
	  contents of the file.

2002-09-01 07:40  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, linuxdoc/distcc.sgml, src/distcc.c, src/io.c,

	  parameter giving default value so that things can default to
	  either on or off.

	  Add new environment variable for client and server,
	  DISTCC_TCP_CORK.  Defaults to on, intended mostly for performance
	  comparison or debugging.

	* NEWS, src/bulk.c, src/distcc.c, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Write

	* src/distcc.c: Only emit the "running locally" notice when the job
	  ought to be distributed but is not.  So having the host set to be
	  local, or non-distributable arguments just silently works.

2002-08-02 14:20  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* contrib/distcc.sh: This file, contributed by Dimitri
	  PAPADOPOULOS-ORFANOS <papadopo@shfj.cea.fr> may be installed as
	  "cc" somewhere on your $PATH ahead of the real gcc.  That allows
	  you to just use regular Makefiles without modifying them to
	  change hardcoded calls to cc.

	  This script will be a bit slow because of the overhead of running
	  things through a shell.  In a future release, this function
	  should be supported directly by distcc, which should be a bit
	  faster.

2002-08-01 23:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Define WAIT_ANY if it is missing, as seems to be
	  the case on Cygwin.

2002-08-01 22:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exec.c: Doc.

2002-08-01 22:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/serve.c: Cygwin needs <signal.h> not <sys/signal.h>

2002-08-01 21:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exec.c: Cope without WCOREDUMP, which is missing on Cygwin.

2002-08-01 21:34  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, configure, configure.ac, src/config.h.in, src/distcc.h: If
	  sa_family_t is missing, try just defining it as int.	Might help
	  Cygwin.

2002-08-01 21:16  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/where.c: Try using fcntl locks in addition to lockf and
	  flock.  Perhaps this will fix Cygwin.  Thanks to Marco Alanen.

2002-08-01 17:41  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dopt.c, opt.h: Make errors from command-line
	  options go to stderr.

2002-08-01 17:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Always build check programs before running checks,
	  even with -j.

	  Specify complete PATH to binaries when running tests, so that
	  they can change into subdirectories.

2002-07-25 17:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Remove file that's no longer in CVS from distro.

2002-07-25 17:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* doc/results.txt: Add results file; not much here yet.

2002-07-25 16:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Add a somewhat-hacky "make dist" target to build a
	  tarball.

	  Compared to just "cvs export", this means we get to include built
	  versions of the documents, which is nice for people who can't
	  easily get the Linuxdoc SGML tools to work.  It does make the
	  binary bigger because there are so many formats, though.

	  Also, we omit things that end users might not want, such as the
	  Latte web site source.  People can get it from CVS (or rsync) if
	  they care.

2002-07-25 16:08  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure, configure.ac: Bump version

2002-07-24 19:03  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Clear the environment before running the
	  child -- this avoids any problems with the developer's
	  environment.

2002-07-24 19:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Change the semantics for detaching a little bit:
	  we now do it once the socket is listening.  This is rather more
	  useful for the test suite, because the suite now knows for sure
	  that when the parent exits, it can go ahead and try to connect.

2002-07-24 18:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* DEPENDENCIES, Makefile.in: Test case now requires python 2.2 for
	  proper unsetenv() semantics

2002-07-24 14:39  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, patches/distc,

	* Makefile.in: "make install" doesn't imply install-linuxdoc

2002-07-12 11:34  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* test/testdistcc.py: Start adding to the test framework a way for
	  test cases to provide their own explanation of why they failed.
	  In particular, for ones that run shell commands, dump out all the
	  commands that were run, and their output.

2002-07-12 11:33  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.c: Give a proper error message for "distcc --fubar",
	  even when we would have chosen to run the command locally.

2002-07-12 11:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: If stdin is neither a socket nor a tty assume
	  --daemon mode.  This is more compatible with previous usage.

2002-07-12 11:19  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Correct message for "distcc --bad-option"

2002-07-10 15:37  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: dcc_set_action_opt: Need to also understand how to
	  transform "gcc -S hello.c" to "gcc -o hello.i -E hello.c" for the
	  client.

2002-07-10 15:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/arg.c, src/distcc.h, src/filename.c:  distcc will now
	  distribute jobs which use -s to compile but not
	   assemble. Previously they were always run locally, but there's
	  no
	   strong reason why they must be.  Unfortunately you need to
	  upgrade
	   both the client and server for this to work, because old servers
	  will
	   refuse to run gcc with -s.

2002-07-10 14:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/tempfile.c: dcc_cleanup_tempfiles: If
	  $DISTCC_SAVE_TEMPS is set to "1", then files are not actually

	* src/dopt.c: distccd_show_usage: Document new options

2002-07-08 17:16  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: dcc_scan_args: -M causes the preprocessor to produce a list
	  of make-style dependencies on header files, either to stdout or
	  to a local file.  It implies -E, so only the preprocessor is run,
	  not the compiler.  There would be no point trying to distribute
	  it even if we could.

2002-07-08 17:13  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c, linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Change --inetd and --daemon
	  defaults:

	   - if both are specified, die
	   - if either is specified, do that
	   - if stdin is a socket or tty assume inetd or daemon
	  respectively
	   - otherwise, complain

2002-07-08 17:03  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2002-07-08 16:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Clarify description of jobs which are

	  can be distributed.

2002-07-08 16:46  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: dcc_scan_args: -M causes the preprocessor to produce a

2002-07-07 21:52  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, man/Makefile.am: Makefile.am patch from Petter Reinholdtsen
	  to correctly install and distribute manpages.  (They need to be

	  patches/ChangeLog, src/ChangeLog: update changelog

2002-06-09 01:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Factor out code to collect children.  Keep track
	  of how many are running.

2002-06-09 01:44  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dparent.c: Change server to a more traditional
	  Unix	model of forking after accepting -- possibly less
	  efficient, but I was having trouble managing an orderly shutdown
	  of all children and this is simpler.

2002-06-09 01:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/Makefile.in: Run autoconf

2002-06-09 01:42  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Doc

2002-06-09 00:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: .S and .s probably works now.

2002-06-09 00:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: arg.c, distcc.h, serve.c: Correctly infer preprocessed
	  filename from source filename.  So for example if we're
	  processing a .S file, then we need to call the tmpfile .s so that
	  the compiler driver understands that it should just run the
	  assembler.

2002-06-09 00:08  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Note that network errors will not be
	  detected.

2002-06-09 00:05  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Doc.

2002-06-09 00:03  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Server should log input and output filename too.

2002-06-08 23:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: arg.c: Log input and output filename.

2002-06-08 23:45  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dparent.c: Daemon parent tries to close listen_fd after
	  forking children, because it's no longer required.

2002-06-08 23:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: Makefile.am, daemon.c, distcc.h, dparent.c: Split
	  daemon-standalone-parent code into a separate file.

2002-06-08 23:35  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Lots of doc updates.

2002-06-08 23:30  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  reasonable

2002-06-08 22:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/: .cvsignore, Makefile: Fix Plucker filename

2002-06-08 22:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/.cvsignore: Add Plucker-ized manual

2002-06-08 22:48  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile: Better name for Plucker file.

2002-06-08 22:40  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Consistently call dcc_exit().

	  Notice immediately when one of our children dies, and reap all of
	  them.

	  When all children die or the parent is signalled, the parent
	  should kill the process group and itself.

2002-06-08 22:31  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/util.h: Fix function attributes.

2002-06-08 22:16  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.h: Clean up prototypes.

2002-06-08 22:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/daemon.c: Clean up exit codes.

	  If fork() fails, log an error, but keep trying.

	  Try to listen on socket before going into background, so that
	  failure is visible to the calling script.

2002-06-08 22:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/distcc.c: Detect invocations like "distcc -c"

2002-06-08 22:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/exitcode.h, linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Renumber exit codes so that
	  100 is a generic distcc failure.

	* src/dopt.c: Fix help message for --pid-file

2002-06-08 21:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, dopt.c, opt.h: Add --pid-file option to save
	  daemon's pid.

2002-06-08 21:42  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in: Update autoconf stuff

2002-06-08 14:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile: Don't build Linuxdoc by default because many
	  machines won't have the tools.

2002-06-08 13:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Fix overzealous memory mistake.

2002-06-07 16:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  src/ChangeLog: auto-update ChangeLog

2002-06-07 11:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* man/: .cvsignore, Makefile, distcc.1, distccd.1: Correction from
	  Juan F. Codagnone for Makefile -- should call groff, not man, to
	  transform manpages

	  Also, add a little stub distccd page.  Both need to be updated to
	  show just the basic information and refer to the manual for more
	  info.

2002-06-06 18:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Improve cross-compile section.

2002-06-06 17:52  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Update doc: test suite has now been
	  written.

2002-06-06 00:22  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, NEWS, configure, configure.ac, src/config.h.in,
	  src/daemon.c, src/distcc.h, src/dopt.c, src/exitcode.h,
	  src/opt.h: Improvements to demon:

	   - make daemon put itself into background when running alone

	   - daemon preforks children according to --tasks option, notes if
	  they
	     die, and kills them when terminated

	   - --port option to set listening port (currently not useful,
	  since
	     you can't set port on client)

2002-06-05 19:00  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/dopt.c: Fix mostly-harmless leaks of poptContext.  Detected
	  by valgrind -- how cool!

2002-06-05 18:53  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/tempfile.c: Add support for TMPDIR.  Not tested.

2002-06-05 17:22  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: bulk.c, daemon.c, distcc.c, exec.c, where.c: Doc.

2002-06-02 15:02  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Test cvs

2002-06-02 14:28  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

2002-06-02 14:18  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/Makefile, man/Makefile: Fix recursive make targets

2002-06-02 14:10  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, linuxdoc/Makefile: automake

2002-06-02 14:09  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: Makefile.in, daemon.c, exitcode.h: Start using consistent
	  return codes across all programs.

2002-06-02 14:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* contrib/make-j: make-j script from Alexandre Oliva
	  <aoliva@redhat.com> for use with distcc

	  Tests which machines are up, and runs Make with concurrency set
	  appropriately.

2002-06-02 13:59  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: .cvsignore, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, arg.c, clinet.c,
	  daemon.c, distcc.c, exitcode.h, h_scanargs.c, help.c, serve.c,
	  srvnet.c, trace.c, trace.h, util.c, util.h, where.c: Many
	  changes:

	  Start using consistent return codes across all programs.

	  Add h_scanargs to allow pyunit to test argument analysis.

	  If -fprofile-args, -ftest-coverage or -x is seen in arguments,
	  run locally.

	  Handle "gcc -c -c hello.c"

	  Better help message.

	  Start handling .s files (doesn't work yet)

	  Fix insertion of program/pid into trace msgs.

2002-06-02 13:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure, configure.ac: FreeBSD installs its version of libpopt
	  into /usr/local/, but does not put that on the default library
	  and header path.  We used to add that path if building on *bsd*,
	  but bje points out that will break cross-compilation, and it's
	  kind of ugly anyhow.

2002-06-02 13:55  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Don't configure from autogen.sh

2002-06-02 13:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	  man directories.

	* NEWS, OLDNEWS: Roll over news.

2002-05-31 16:36  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure, configure.ac: Apparently FreeBSD needs sys/types.h
	  before netinet/in.h.	From Frerich Raabe.

2002-05-31 16:20  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* linuxdoc/distcc.sgml: Add distcc link.

2002-05-28 22:56  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Go ahead and release.

2002-05-28 22:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* aclocal.m4, configure, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Bump
	  version to 0.3.

	  Try to get "make dist" working.

2002-05-28 19:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, src/Makefile.in: rerun autoconf

2002-05-28 19:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/.cvsignore: Ignore temp file.

2002-05-28 15:29  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, src/config.h.in,
	  src/help.c: Export gnu host triple in --version

2002-05-28 15:07  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.guess, config.sub, configure,
	  configure.ac, src/Makefile.in: Detect BSD, and add /usr/local/ to
	  the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

2002-05-28 14:31  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* aclocal.m4: Silly autoconf

2002-05-28 14:24  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* patches/: distc, distc++: Single files that call 'distcc gcc' --
	  possibly needed for Makefiles that assume the compiler is a
	  single word.	(Does this include libtool?)

2002-05-28 14:18  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: .cvsignore, Makefile.in, config.h.in: Check in extra
	  autoconf-generated files.

2002-05-28 14:17  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/timebuild: Very primitive script for timing tests.

2002-05-28 13:52  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: h_exten.c, h_issource.c: Additional fixes for
	  rs_program_name.

2002-05-28 13:48  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac, src/serve.c: BSD needs
	  sys/signal.h.

2002-05-28 12:43  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* .cvsignore, COPYING.FDL, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4,
	  configure, install-sh, missing, mkinstalldirs: Keep a copy of
	  autotools files in CVS, to help people on machines with different
	  versions.  Bah, humbug!

2002-05-28 12:37  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* ChangeLog, doc/ChangeLog, linuxdoc/ChangeLog, man/ChangeLog:
	  Regenerate ChangeLogs

2002-05-28 12:28  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: ChangeLog, daemon.c, distcc.c, trace.c, trace.h: Clean up
	  rs_program_name shmozlle

2002-05-27 00:58  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/srvnet.c: Doc

2002-05-27 00:14  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Doc

	* .cvsignore, src/.cvsignore: Ignore extra garbage

2002-05-26 01:38  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac: Need to also look in sys/types.h for in_port_t on
	  BSD.

2002-05-26 01:35  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/arg.c: Good fix from Ian Reinhart Geiser for silly mistake in
	  dcc_set_file_extension that I think would show up in "gcc -c
	  hello.c".

2002-05-26 01:27  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS, src/serve.c: Ignore SIGPIPE in daemon as well as client.

	  Thanks to Ben Elliston.

2002-05-26 01:21  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/clinet.c, NEWS: Try to cope without in_port_t.

	  Thanks to Luke Gorrie.

2002-05-26 01:11  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/: daemon.c, distcc.c, h_exten.c, h_issource.c, trace.c: Cope
	  without program_invocation_short_name, as some GNU libc/cc
	  combinations don't seem to have it (???)

2002-05-26 00:54  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/trace.c: Replace calls to strnlen with strlen, because it
	  will always be short enough and FreeBSD doesn't have strnlen

2002-05-26 00:49  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/help.c: Ignore strange new automake variables,
	  just use PACKAGE and VERSION

2002-05-26 00:47  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Fix Ian's name.

2002-05-26 00:46  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: M-/ strikes again :-)

2002-05-26 00:42  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/io.c: If there are no corks on this computer, don't try to
	  use them.

2002-05-26 00:32  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* configure.ac, src/arg.c, src/bulk.c, src/clinet.c, src/daemon.c,
	  src/distcc.c, src/exec.c, src/h_exten.c, src/h_issource.c,
	  src/io.c, src/rpc.c, src/serve.c, src/srvnet.c, src/tempfile.c,
	  src/util.c, src/where.c, NEWS: Test for sys/sendfile.h and
	  sendfile(), and if we don't have them use plain read/write
	  instead.

	  Remove unnecessary dependencies on sys/sendfile.h

2002-05-26 00:23  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Don't say "make all", because on some platforms you
	  might really need gmake.

2002-05-26 00:08  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Need to also run aclocal to install automake stuff.

	  Also need to run autoheader early on in the process, because
	  automake depends on finding config.h.in.

2002-05-26 00:04  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* NEWS: Note help with automake

2002-05-26 00:01  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Handle ChangeLog

2002-05-25 23:57  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/.cvsignore: More test cases

2002-05-25 23:55  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: Get rid of editing mistake.

	  _SOURCES is a magic name for automake, so don't use it for common
	  source.

	  Thanks to Frerich Raabe.

2002-05-25 23:50  Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org>

	* autogen.sh: Add a script to do everything necessary to build from
	  CVS.	This is needed because automake requires a spliff to get
